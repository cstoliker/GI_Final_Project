### Business Class Battle

### Background / Story:
Do you have a job?  Do you have to work with other people at your job?  Do those people sometimes annoy you?  Do they sometimes annoy you excessively?  Does this sometimes cause you anger?  Instead of acting on that anger, why not try playing Business Class Battle?  The game where you can take out all of your office place related frustrations!  Just be sure not to play it at work!  

### Game Features:
Upon starting the game, you will see a main menu with three choices; start, options, and quit.  Upon clicking start, it was my intention to take the player to a set of menus that allowed them to choose the number of players, their characters, weapons, and the level they would be playing on.  However, I wanted to finish the gameplay before creating all the assets.  This means that currently the start button just takes you straight to the game.

Unfortunately, the option don't work just yet.

Once in the game, you have 60 seconds to kill as many enemies as you can before time runs out.  At the time I'm writing this, I have yet to get the enemies to attack, so the isn't actually any way to die.  However, you'll notice the health bar on screen.  This health bar works and can be tested by pressing the t key.
